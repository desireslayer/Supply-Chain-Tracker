# Supply Chain Tracker

## Project Title
**Supply Chain Tracker - Blockchain-Based Product Journey Management**

## Project Description

The Supply Chain Tracker is a decentralized smart contract built on the Stellar blockchain using the Soroban SDK. This innovative solution enables transparent and immutable tracking of products as they move through the supply chain from manufacturer to consumer.

In traditional supply chains, tracking product movement is often fragmented across multiple systems, leading to inefficiencies, lack of transparency, and potential fraud. Our smart contract addresses these challenges by creating a single source of truth on the blockchain where every step of a product's journey is permanently recorded and easily verifiable.

The contract allows manufacturers to register products on-chain, track their status through various stages (manufactured, in transit, delivered, received), and provides real-time statistics about the entire supply chain. This creates accountability, reduces counterfeiting, and builds consumer trust by allowing anyone to verify a product's authenticity and journey.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to revolutionize global supply chain management by leveraging blockchain technology to create a transparent, efficient, and trustworthy ecosystem. We aim to:

- **Eliminate Counterfeiting**: By providing immutable proof of product origin and journey, we help combat the multi-billion dollar counterfeit goods industry
- **Increase Transparency**: Enable consumers to verify the authenticity and journey of products they purchase
- **Improve Efficiency**: Reduce paperwork and manual verification processes by automating supply chain tracking
- **Build Trust**: Create a trustless system where all stakeholders can independently verify product information
- **Enable Sustainability**: Allow tracking of ethical sourcing and environmental impact throughout the supply chain

We envision a future where every product has a digital identity on the blockchain, empowering consumers with information and holding manufacturers accountable for their claims.

## Key Features

### 1. **Product Registration**
- Manufacturers can register products with unique IDs on the blockchain
- Each product record includes name, manufacturer details, and timestamp
- Automatic generation of unique product identifiers
- Immutable record creation that cannot be altered or deleted

### 2. **Status Tracking**
- Track products through multiple stages: Manufactured → In Transit → Delivered → Received
- Real-time status updates with timestamp recording
- Complete audit trail of product movement
- Prevention of unauthorized status changes

### 3. **Product Verification**
- Anyone can query product details using the product ID
- Retrieve complete product history including manufacture time and current location
- Verify manufacturer authenticity and product legitimacy
- Access to all status transitions throughout the product's journey

### 4. **Supply Chain Analytics**
- Real-time statistics on total products in the system
- Track number of products currently in transit
- Monitor delivery completion rates
- Aggregate data for supply chain optimization

### 5. **Decentralized Trust**
- No central authority controls the data
- Transparent and verifiable by all stakeholders
- Permanent record storage on Stellar blockchain
- Resistant to tampering and fraud

### 6. **Lightweight & Efficient**
- Simple 4-function design for ease of use
- Optimized storage patterns for cost efficiency
- Fast query responses for product information
- Low transaction costs on Stellar network

## Future Scope

### Enhanced Features
- **Multi-Party Authorization**: Implement role-based access control for manufacturers, distributors, retailers, and consumers
- **IoT Integration**: Connect with IoT sensors for automatic status updates (temperature, location, handling conditions)
- **QR Code Generation**: Generate unique QR codes for products that link to blockchain records
- **Batch Tracking**: Enable tracking of product batches rather than individual items for efficiency
- **Recall Management**: Add functionality to track and manage product recalls efficiently

### Advanced Functionality
- **Smart Contracts Integration**: Connect with payment systems for automated settlements upon delivery
- **Supply Chain Finance**: Enable financing and insurance products based on supply chain data
- **Carbon Footprint Tracking**: Calculate and display environmental impact of product journey
- **Compliance Verification**: Automated checking against regulatory requirements
- **Dispute Resolution**: Built-in mechanisms for handling disputes between supply chain parties

### Scalability Improvements
- **Cross-Chain Bridge**: Enable interoperability with other blockchain networks
- **Layer-2 Solutions**: Implement scaling solutions for high-volume supply chains
- **Sharding**: Distribute data across multiple contracts for better performance
- **Archival System**: Move old records to cheaper storage while maintaining verifiability

### User Experience
- **Mobile Application**: Develop consumer-facing apps for easy product verification
- **Dashboard Analytics**: Create comprehensive analytics dashboards for supply chain managers
- **Notification System**: Real-time alerts for status changes and anomalies
- **Multi-language Support**: Expand contract to support international supply chains

### Integration & Ecosystem
- **ERP Integration**: Connect with existing enterprise resource planning systems
- **Marketplace Integration**: Enable e-commerce platforms to display blockchain verification
- **API Development**: Provide RESTful APIs for third-party integrations
- **Industry Standards**: Work towards establishing industry-wide standards for blockchain supply chain tracking

## Contract Functions

### 1. `register_product(name, manufacturer) → product_id`
Registers a new product in the supply chain with manufacturer details.

### 2. `update_status(product_id, new_status)`
Updates the current status of a product as it moves through the supply chain.

### 3. `view_product(product_id) → Product`
Retrieves complete information about a specific product.

### 4. `view_chain_stats() → ChainStats`
Returns overall statistics about the supply chain.

## Getting Started

To deploy this contract:
1. Install Soroban CLI and Rust toolchain
2. Build the contract: `cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release`
3. Deploy to Stellar testnet/mainnet using Soroban CLI
4. Interact with contract functions using Soroban CLI or SDK

## Usage Example

```rust
// Register a new product
let product_id = contract.register_product(
    env,
    String::from_str(&env, "Smartphone X"),
    String::from_str(&env, "TechCorp Manufacturing")
);

// Update status to in transit
contract.update_status(env, product_id, ProductStatus::InTransit);

// View product details
let product = contract.view_product(env, product_id);

// Get supply chain statistics
let stats = contract.view_chain_stats(env);
```
